# Aleph3
aleph3 is a modern, extensible computer algebra system written in C++20. It provides fast symbolic computation and mathematical expression evaluation, with a focus on clarity, performance, and a familiar, Mathematica-inspired syntax.

## Features
- Basic algebraic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Symbolic computation support
- Extensible architecture for advanced features

## Getting Started
To build Aleph3, ensure you have CMake 3.20+ and a C++20-compatible compiler installed. Follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sergiorf/aleph3.git
   cd aleph3
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build
   cmake --build build
   cd build
   ctest -C Debug --output-on-failure --verbose
   ```

3. Run the Aleph3 CLI:
   ```bash
   ./build/bin/aleph3
   ```
