# Mathix
_A symbolic math system and computational software written in C++._

## âœ¨Overview

Mathix is a powerful and flexible computer algebra system (CAS) written in modern C++ (C++20). It enables users to perform symbolic computations, manipulate mathematical expressions, and define custom functions.

## Features
- Basic algebraic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Symbolic computation support
- Extensible architecture for advanced features

## Getting Started
To build Mathix, ensure you have CMake 3.20+ and a C++20-compatible compiler installed. Follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sergiorf/mathix.git
   cd mathix
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build
   cmake --build build
   cd build
   ctest -C Debug --output-on-failure --verbose
   ```

3. Run the Mathix CLI:
   ```bash
   ./build/bin/mathix
   ```

## Looking for Contributors ðŸš€
